# Advanced Regression - Surprise Housing

## Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Assignment Goal

Requirement is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


## Business Goal

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.
